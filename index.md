Workshops are a great tool to create community and advance the careers at all stages. In particular, phylogenetic comparative methods have seen an exponential growth since the 90s with many tools changing rapidly. 

These tutorials are simple introduction to topics, they are just a starting point for users to start their paths into discovery of complex methods.

If you find one of these tutorials useful, or you find a mistake please drop an email to roszenil(at)uky(dot)edu telling me about it.
